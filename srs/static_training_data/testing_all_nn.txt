no feature***I was looking for an all purpose camera with a macro feature so I could take photos for ebay.####purpose camera##macro feature###camera##feature##photos##ebay###purpose##macro### 
no feature***I purchased the Coolpix as a Black Friday Amazon special.####black friday###coolpix##friday###black##special### 
no feature***Ultimately, I wound up returning it.#### ### ### ### 
pictures***It had a nice feel but the photos were mediocre.####nice feel###feel##photos##mediocre###nice### 
no feature***I honestly could take better photos with my phone.#### ###photos##phone###better### 
no feature***I did like the options on the Coolpix.#### ###options##coolpix### ### 
pictures***I liked the shutter speed and the wide angle of an average photo, but I felt the images had the distortion of a very cheap disposable camera.####wide angle##average photo##disposable camera##shutter speed###shutter##speed##angle##photo##images##distortion##camera###wide##average##cheap##disposable### 
pictures***Cheap cameras have a tendency to distort facial features - making a nose appear larger or making eyes appear more deep-set than they actually are.####cheap cameras##facial features###cameras##tendency##features##eyes###cheap##facial##nose##appear##larger##deep-set### 
no feature***Most people hate photos of themselves taken with cheap cameras.####cheap cameras###people##photos##cameras###cheap### 
no feature***You can occasionally get lucky and grab a nice shot, but overall cheap cameras make lousy portraits.####nice shot##cheap cameras##lousy portraits###shot##cameras##portraits###lucky##nice##overall##cheap##lousy### 
pictures***I suppose this camera would be nice for someone who likes to take scenery or action photos.####action photos###camera##someone##scenery##action##photos###nice### 
no feature***I wound up buying a larger Coolpix L320 and am thrilled.####coolpix l320###coolpix##l320###larger###

no feature***I have this camera since one year and I'm really dissapointed.#### ###camera##year##i'm### ###

other features***The camera is extreme slow to take pictures, even if using the divers options.####divers options###camera##pictures##divers##options###extreme##slow### 
pictures***The good thing is the option of color selection taking pictures, is nice and fun!####good thing##color selection###thing##option##color##selection##pictures##fun###good##nice### 
no feature***I own this, however I purchased at another Mart with a "wall" for the same price being advertised her as a lightning deal... and it stinks.####" wall##lightning deal###mart##"##wall##"##price##lightning##deal### ### 
no feature***Gave it to my seven year old and purchased another Kodak.#### ###year##kodak###old### 
no feature***Everything is relative so I will be comparing Nikon's Coolpix P250 to its main competitor the Canon SX50 (they sell for the same price).####nikon's coolpix##main competitor##coolpix p250##canon sx50###everything##coolpix##p250##competitor##canon##sx50##price###relative##nikon's##main### 
pictures***WHAT NIKON DID RIGHT:Under ideal conditions, the 18.1 megapixel Nikon creates images with higher resolution than the Canon.####ideal conditions##megapixel nikon###nikon##ideal##conditions##megapixel##nikon##images##resolution##canon###right##higher### 
pictures***My images shot at a resolution chart showed that the Nikon had a real resolution of about 12 megapixels (18.1 advertized) and the cannon resolved about 9 megapixels (12 advertized).####real resolution##resolution chart###images##resolution##chart##nikon##resolution##megapixels##cannon##megapixels###real### 
zoom***But under actual conditions, in daylight, they both perform about the same because the Canon has a much better lens.####actual conditions###conditions##daylight##canon##lens###actual##better### 
zoom***When zoomed or at in high contrast situations, the Nikon makes larger files that are not as clear and sharp as the Canon and have some purple fringing around the edges when blown up.####high contrast##purple fringing##contrast situations###contrast##situations##nikon##files##canon##fringing##edges###high##larger##clear##sharp##purple### 
pictures***The image sensor in the Nikon is a newer technology and really does perform much better in low light.####low light##image sensor###image##sensor##nikon##technology##light###newer##low###better
other features***Nikon has a timer feature that I have found on no other camera.####timer feature###nikon##timer##feature##camera### ### 
other features***You can set it up to start snapping pictures every 30 seconds, or 1 minute or 5 minutes.#### ###pictures##seconds##minute##minutes### ### 
no feature***This is very cool, you can set it on a tripod and take nature shots all night waiting for a deer to come eat your corn, or you can put together a time laps movie from the frames, or set it up to catch violators in the act.####laps movie##nature shots###tripod##nature##shots##night##deer##corn##time##movie##frames##violators##act###cool##laps### 
no feature***The possibilities are huge!#### ###possibilities###huge### 
no feature***Other cameras, including the Canon, won't do this.#### ###cameras##canon### ### 
screen***(and it would have been so easy in their software)The viewing screen is big and bright.#### ###software##screen###easy##big##bright### 
no feature***The best I've seen and much better than the Canon.#### ###i've##canon###best##better### 
other features***Nikon has a built in GPS.#### ###nikon##gps### ### 
no feature***I didn't test it; I'll never use it.#### ###test##use### ### 
no feature***Canon doesn't have this feature.####canon doesn't###canon##doesn't##feature### ### 
zoom***WHAT NIKON DID WRONG:The Nikon has focus problems when using the self timer and in movie mode.####self timer##movie mode###nikon##nikon##problems##self##timer##movie##mode###wrong### 
video***If you start the movie recording, and then step in front of the camera, it mostly focuses on the back wall and your face is fuzzy.####movie recording##back wall###movie##recording##front##camera##back##wall##face###fuzzy### 
no feature***The camera never seems to recover.#### ###camera### ### 
no feature***This is very bad (come on Nikon).#### ###nikon###bad### 
no feature***I have tried every combination of focus modes.####focus modes###combination##focus##modes### ### 
detection***Face detect doesn't seem to work after the movie is recording.#### ###face##doesn't##movie### ### 
no feature***I never had a camera this bad.#### ###camera###bad### 
ease of use***You are forced to use manual focus.####manual focus###focus###manual### 
video***This problem does not affect traditional movie recording, focus works fine when you are behind the camera shooting a subject in front of you.####traditional movie##movie recording##focus works###problem##movie##recording##focus##works##camera##subject##front###traditional### 
ease of use***In order to use Nikon's electronic viewfinder, you need to fold and tuck the flip out screen.####electronic viewfinder###order##viewfinder##flip##screen###nikon's##electronic### 
no feature***This is a big nuisance on a sunny day going back and forth.####big nuisance##sunny day###nuisance##day##forth###big##sunny### 
ease of use***Every other camera in the world changes displays using the display button; the Canon does.####display button###camera##world##displays##display##button##canon### ### 
quality***(and it would have been so easy to implement in Nikon's software, the button is already there)The Nikon camera feels cheap.####nikon's software##nikon camera##camera feels###software##button##camera##feels###easy##nikon's##nikon### 
quality***The lens rattles (but doesn't exhibit any problems) and the flip screen doesn't lock in place.####lens rattles##flip screen##doesn't lock###lens##rattles##exhibit##problems##flip##screen##doesn't##lock##place### ### 
quality***The Canon feels solid as a rock.####canon feels###canon##feels##rock### ### 
battery***The charging system that ships with the Nikon uses a cable that charges the battery in the camera.####charging system###charging##system##cable##battery##camera###nikon### 
battery***This is a nuisance and I don't need another charging unit with a cord to get tangled in the drawer.#### ###nuisance##unit##cord##drawer### ### 
battery***So you have to fork out another $30 or$ 40 for a charger and spare battery.####spare battery###charger##battery###spare### 
battery***The Canon ships with a nice charger that plugs into the wall and holds the battery.####nice charger##canon ships###canon##ships##charger##wall##battery###nice### 
pictures***All outdoor images are slightly overexposed.####outdoor images###images###outdoor### 
no feature***This can be corrected by bumping down the aperture 2 stops when shooting, but what was Nikon thinking.####nikon thinking###aperture##stops##shooting##thinking###nikon### 
no feature***The Canon is right on the mark.#### ###canon##mark###right### 
no feature***WHAT CANON DID RIGHT:The Canon super zoom is much more powerful, 50X vs 42X.####canon super###canon##canon##super##zoom##vs###powerful### 
zoom***The Canon lens is truly remarkable.#### ###canon###remarkable### 
zoom***You can photograph the moons of Jupiter on a clear night.####clear night###moons##jupiter##night###clear### 
zoom***I tested it next to the Nikon on distant road signs and you could read text from a mile away using the Canon.####distant road##road signs###nikon##road##signs##text##mile##canon###next##distant### 
no feature***There was no comparison.#### ###comparison### ### 
zoom***The Nikon doesn't have the range and the image was a little fuzzy at the longest extent compared Canon's superior optics.####little fuzzy##superior optics##nikon doesn't###nikon##doesn't##range##image##fuzzy##extent##canon's##optics###little##longest##superior### 
price***For the price, this is a good camera.####good camera###price##camera###good### 
no feature***Not a "great" camera, but a fairly good one.####great "##" camera###"##camera###"##great##good### 
zoom***I would consider it high end for the average consumer, with features superior to other point-and-shoots in its price range: Wi-fi capable (ability to connect to iOS and Android devices for viewing/sharing your photos and videos via the optional WU-1a adapter), built-in GPS (to geotag your photos), 18MP CMOS sensor, a zoom lens with incredible focal range (24mm-1,000mm), and 1080 HD video.####high end##average consumer##android devices##optional wu##built-in gps##focal range##price range##cmos sensor##-1,000 mm##hd video###end##consumer##features##point-and-shoots##price##range##ability##ios##devices##photos##videos##wu##adapter##gps##photos##cmos##sensor##zoom##range##-1,000##mm##hd##video###high##average##wi-fi##capable##android##/##optional##built-in##incredible##focal### 
ease of use***For the price, that's a nice set-up, a camera with advanced features with a decent ease-of-use, requiring little knowledge of photographic techniques.####nice set-up##advanced features##decent ease-of-use##little knowledge##photographic techniques###price##set-up##camera##features##ease-of-use##knowledge##techniques###nice##advanced##decent##little##photographic### 
no feature***Many of us, however, want to go beyond 'picture-taking' and seek an advanced camera that is not in an advanced price range.####picture-taking '##advanced camera##advanced price##price range###'##camera##price##range###many##picture-taking##advanced##advanced### 
no feature***And this is where the P520 is attractive but, ultimately, falls a bit short of our desires.#### ###p520##bit##desires###attractive##short### 
pictures***For example, there's no RAW: your images are captured in JPEG only.#### ###example##images##jpeg###raw### 
other features***There's a decent pop-up flash but no hot shoe.####pop-up flash##hot shoe###flash##shoe###decent##pop-up##hot### 
zoom***Also, the impressive zoom is not so impressive with regard to its speed, either its lens speed (f/3.0-5.9) or autofocus speed (fairly slow but not quite horrible).####impressive zoom##f /##lens speed###zoom##regard##speed##lens##speed##/##speed###impressive##impressive##f##horrible### 
zoom***However, it is a nice, glass, Nikkor lens; and, to be fair, it would be quite a feat to bring such a long zoom well under f/3, given the price range.####nikkor lens##long zoom##price range###glass##lens##feat##zoom##f##price##range###nice##nikkor##fair##long### 
zoom***Personally, I would have traded focal length for speed: yes, it's impressive to go out to 1000mm, but I would have taken 800mm with an f/2.8-5.0 lens; though Nikon has built-in stabilization features for both photos and video (called 'Active VR mode' for video), you're not going to do hand-held shots at that 1000mm focal length, especially video.####focal length##it's impressive##built-in stabilization##active vr##hand-held shots##focal length##stabilization features##vr mode###length##speed##impressive##lens##nikon##stabilization##features##photos##video##vr##mode##video##shots##length##video###focal##it's##f##/##2.8-##built-in##active##hand-held##focal### 
screen***Other aspects of the camera will please everyone: full manual exposure control along with multiple auto/semi-auto exposure modes, a nice and large tilting Vari-Angle LCD monitor, an excellent CMOS sensor (1/2.3 in.####manual exposure##multiple auto##semi-auto exposure##vari-angle lcd##excellent cmos##exposure control##exposure modes##lcd monitor##cmos sensor###aspects##camera##everyone##exposure##control##auto##exposure##modes##lcd##monitor##cmos##sensor###full##manual##multiple##semi-auto##nice##large##vari-angle##excellent### 
size***), and a nice weight and feel to the body.####nice weight###weight##feel##body###nice### 
size***This last point is what drew me to the 520 in the first place: I just bought a P310 and although I love it, especially for its small size and portability (shirt pocket), I cannot get used to shooting outdoors with such a small camera.####last point##first place##small size##shirt pocket##small camera###point##place##p310##size##portability##pocket##outdoors##camera###last##first##small##shirt##small### 
size***The 520 is just perfect; that solid DSLR feel but with a modest weight (20 ounces).####solid dslr##modest weight##dslr feel###dslr##feel##weight##ounces###perfect##solid##modest### 
zoom***Yes, I wish the P520 had a few more pro-like features and wasn't so extreme in its focal length, but this is a very good camera overall.####pro-like features##focal length##good camera##camera overall###p520##features##wasn't##length##camera##overall###pro-like##extreme##focal##good### 
no feature***I'm giving it 3 stars for the reasons stated above.#### ###i'm##stars##reasons### ### 
no feature***However, if you're someone not interested in advanced photography and just want a very nice camera with higher-end consumer features, this is a borderline 4-star camera and not bad for the price.####advanced photography##nice camera##higher-end consumer##consumer features##star camera###someone##photography##camera##consumer##features##borderline##star##camera##price###interested##advanced##nice##higher-end##bad### 
no feature***Did a lot of research and read reviews as well as YouTube about this camera.####read reviews###lot##research##reviews##youtube##camera###read### 
no feature***Mostly very good comments.####good comments###comments###good### 
no feature***Now that I have used this camera for a couple weeks I can say that I made a good decision in purchasing it.####couple weeks##good decision###camera##weeks##decision###couple##good### 
ease of use***I get all the manual control that I had on my old SLR camera,but with this camera it is a lot easier to use and do the the manual settings that I like.####manual control##old slr##manual settings##slr camera###control##slr##camera##camera##lot##settings###manual##old##easier##manual### 
no feature***One feature I wished it had is Stop Down Metering, I have found no camera of this type that offers this feature either so I didn't mark it down for this.#### ###feature##metering##camera##type##feature##mark### ### 
pictures***My pictures are very good and the video (which was not the reason I bought this camera) works great even at max zoom of 1000mm which allowed me to get fantastic videos at a recent outdoor concert, as long as I had good lighting the focusing worked great and was pretty fast.####fantastic videos##recent outdoor##max zoom##outdoor concert###pictures##video##reason##camera##max##zoom##videos##outdoor##concert##focusing###good##great##fantastic##recent##good##great### 
zoom***The zoom works good and very smooth, the VR (Vibration Reduction) works way better than I imagined at the long Zoom range.####long zoom##vibration reduction##zoom range###zoom##vr##vibration##reduction##way##zoom##range###good##long###better
screen***I have read some folks wished there was a button to switch between the EVF and the main viewing screen but I like the fact that when I fold the large view screen flat in it's storage area the EVF comes on automatically and when I unfold the large viewing screen it comes on automatically so I have no extra buttons to push.####main viewing##large view##it's storage##extra buttons##viewing screen##view screen##storage area###folks##button##evf##viewing##screen##fact##view##screen##storage##area##evf##screen##buttons###main##large##flat##it's##large##extra###
