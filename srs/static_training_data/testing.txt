no feature***I was looking for an all purpose camera with a macro feature so I could take photos for ebay.
no feature***I purchased the Coolpix as a Black Friday Amazon special.
no feature***Ultimately, I wound up returning it.
pictures***It had a nice feel but the photos were mediocre.
no feature***I honestly could take better photos with my phone.
no feature***I did like the options on the Coolpix.
pictures***I liked the shutter speed and the wide angle of an average photo, but I felt the images had the distortion of a very cheap disposable camera.
pictures***Cheap cameras have a tendency to distort facial features - making a nose appear larger or making eyes appear more deep-set than they actually are.
no feature***Most people hate photos of themselves taken with cheap cameras.
no feature***You can occasionally get lucky and grab a nice shot, but overall cheap cameras make lousy portraits.
pictures***I suppose this camera would be nice for someone who likes to take scenery or action photos.
no feature***I wound up buying a larger Coolpix L320 and am thrilled.
pictures***The L320 has a beautiful way of capturing an image and is amazingly easy to use.
pictures***you can edit photos on the camera.12X zoom at tiny camera body!and most important - shoot very nice pictures,personally don't like the touch screen because sometimes you can touch it by accident.stopping movie clip is inconvenient.but all together excellent camera at an excellent price

ease of use***For many years had other manufacturers, digital or not, none were the same easy use or clarity.
zoom***It is one of the worst cameras I've used, the touch controls are not accurate and the user experience is horrible, I was unable to focus the lens on macro mode, all the pictures came out blurry or moved.
pictures***It is one of the worst cameras I've used, the touch controls are not accurate and the user experience is horrible, I was unable to focus the lens on macro mode, all the pictures came out blurry or moved.
no feature***Returned and bought a different model, Nikon should be ashamed of this model.
no feature***I have this camera since one year and I'm really dissapointed.
battery***It has not an external chager.
other features***The camera is extreme slow to take pictures, even if using the divers options.
pictures***The good thing is the option of color selection taking pictures, is nice and fun!
no feature***I own this, however I purchased at another Mart with a "wall" for the same price being advertised her as a lightning deal... and it stinks.
no feature***Gave it to my seven year old and purchased another Kodak.
no feature***Everything is relative so I will be comparing Nikon's Coolpix P250 to its main competitor the Canon SX50 (they sell for the same price).
pictures***WHAT NIKON DID RIGHT:Under ideal conditions, the 18.1 megapixel Nikon creates images with higher resolution than the Canon.
pictures***My images shot at a resolution chart showed that the Nikon had a real resolution of about 12 megapixels (18.1 advertized) and the cannon resolved about 9 megapixels (12 advertized).
zoom***But under actual conditions, in daylight, they both perform about the same because the Canon has a much better lens.
zoom***When zoomed or at in high contrast situations, the Nikon makes larger files that are not as clear and sharp as the Canon and have some purple fringing around the edges when blown up.
pictures***The image sensor in the Nikon is a newer technology and really does perform much better in low light.
other features***Nikon has a timer feature that I have found on no other camera.
other features***You can set it up to start snapping pictures every 30 seconds, or 1 minute or 5 minutes.
no feature***This is very cool, you can set it on a tripod and take nature shots all night waiting for a deer to come eat your corn, or you can put together a time laps movie from the frames, or set it up to catch violators in the act.
no feature***The possibilities are huge!
no feature***Other cameras, including the Canon, won't do this.
screen***(and it would have been so easy in their software)The viewing screen is big and bright.
no feature***The best I've seen and much better than the Canon.
other features***Nikon has a built in GPS.
no feature***I didn't test it; I'll never use it.
no feature***Canon doesn't have this feature.
zoom***WHAT NIKON DID WRONG:The Nikon has focus problems when using the self timer and in movie mode.
video***If you start the movie recording, and then step in front of the camera, it mostly focuses on the back wall and your face is fuzzy.
no feature***The camera never seems to recover.
no feature***This is very bad (come on Nikon).
no feature***I have tried every combination of focus modes.
detection***Face detect doesn't seem to work after the movie is recording.
no feature***I never had a camera this bad.
ease of use***You are forced to use manual focus.
video***This problem does not affect traditional movie recording, focus works fine when you are behind the camera shooting a subject in front of you.
ease of use***In order to use Nikon's electronic viewfinder, you need to fold and tuck the flip out screen.
no feature***This is a big nuisance on a sunny day going back and forth.
ease of use***Every other camera in the world changes displays using the display button; the Canon does.
quality***(and it would have been so easy to implement in Nikon's software, the button is already there)The Nikon camera feels cheap.
quality***The lens rattles (but doesn't exhibit any problems) and the flip screen doesn't lock in place.
quality***The Canon feels solid as a rock.
battery***The charging system that ships with the Nikon uses a cable that charges the battery in the camera.
battery***This is a nuisance and I don't need another charging unit with a cord to get tangled in the drawer.
battery***So you have to fork out another $30 or$ 40 for a charger and spare battery.
battery***The Canon ships with a nice charger that plugs into the wall and holds the battery.
pictures***All outdoor images are slightly overexposed.
no feature***This can be corrected by bumping down the aperture 2 stops when shooting, but what was Nikon thinking.
no feature***The Canon is right on the mark.
no feature***WHAT CANON DID RIGHT:The Canon super zoom is much more powerful, 50X vs 42X.
zoom***The Canon lens is truly remarkable.
zoom***You can photograph the moons of Jupiter on a clear night.
zoom***I tested it next to the Nikon on distant road signs and you could read text from a mile away using the Canon.
no feature***There was no comparison.
zoom***The Nikon doesn't have the range and the image was a little fuzzy at the longest extent compared Canon's superior optics.
price***For the price, this is a good camera.
no feature***Not a "great" camera, but a fairly good one.
zoom***I would consider it high end for the average consumer, with features superior to other point-and-shoots in its price range: Wi-fi capable (ability to connect to iOS and Android devices for viewing/sharing your photos and videos via the optional WU-1a adapter), built-in GPS (to geotag your photos), 18MP CMOS sensor, a zoom lens with incredible focal range (24mm-1,000mm), and 1080 HD video.
ease of use***For the price, that's a nice set-up, a camera with advanced features with a decent ease-of-use, requiring little knowledge of photographic techniques.
no feature***Many of us, however, want to go beyond 'picture-taking' and seek an advanced camera that is not in an advanced price range.
no feature***And this is where the P520 is attractive but, ultimately, falls a bit short of our desires.
pictures***For example, there's no RAW: your images are captured in JPEG only.
other features***There's a decent pop-up flash but no hot shoe.
zoom***Also, the impressive zoom is not so impressive with regard to its speed, either its lens speed (f/3.0-5.9) or autofocus speed (fairly slow but not quite horrible).
zoom***However, it is a nice, glass, Nikkor lens; and, to be fair, it would be quite a feat to bring such a long zoom well under f/3, given the price range.
zoom***Personally, I would have traded focal length for speed: yes, it's impressive to go out to 1000mm, but I would have taken 800mm with an f/2.8-5.0 lens; though Nikon has built-in stabilization features for both photos and video (called 'Active VR mode' for video), you're not going to do hand-held shots at that 1000mm focal length, especially video.
screen***Other aspects of the camera will please everyone: full manual exposure control along with multiple auto/semi-auto exposure modes, a nice and large tilting Vari-Angle LCD monitor, an excellent CMOS sensor (1/2.3 in.
size***), and a nice weight and feel to the body.
size***This last point is what drew me to the 520 in the first place: I just bought a P310 and although I love it, especially for its small size and portability (shirt pocket), I cannot get used to shooting outdoors with such a small camera.
size***The 520 is just perfect; that solid DSLR feel but with a modest weight (20 ounces).
zoom***Yes, I wish the P520 had a few more pro-like features and wasn't so extreme in its focal length, but this is a very good camera overall.
no feature***I'm giving it 3 stars for the reasons stated above.
no feature***However, if you're someone not interested in advanced photography and just want a very nice camera with higher-end consumer features, this is a borderline 4-star camera and not bad for the price.
no feature***Did a lot of research and read reviews as well as YouTube about this camera.
no feature***Mostly very good comments.
no feature***Now that I have used this camera for a couple weeks I can say that I made a good decision in purchasing it.
ease of use***I get all the manual control that I had on my old SLR camera,but with this camera it is a lot easier to use and do the the manual settings that I like.
no feature***One feature I wished it had is Stop Down Metering, I have found no camera of this type that offers this feature either so I didn't mark it down for this.
pictures***My pictures are very good and the video (which was not the reason I bought this camera) works great even at max zoom of 1000mm which allowed me to get fantastic videos at a recent outdoor concert, as long as I had good lighting the focusing worked great and was pretty fast.
zoom***The zoom works good and very smooth, the VR (Vibration Reduction) works way better than I imagined at the long Zoom range.
screen***I have read some folks wished there was a button to switch between the EVF and the main viewing screen but I like the fact that when I fold the large view screen flat in it's storage area the EVF comes on automatically and when I unfold the large viewing screen it comes on automatically so I have no extra buttons to push.
no feature***Frustrating when you're trying to capture a picture.
no feature***I would not buy this camera again.
no feature***The Easyshare software no longer works on either of my computers, so I'm now using Picasa.
no feature***I think Kodak is a nice idea, but their software doesn't perform well, and this camera isn't meant to be used every day.
price***GOOD PRICE.
ease of use***EASY TO USE.
pictures***GOOD PICTURES, EXCEPT SUNSET PICTURE HAD NO COLOR, EVEN WITH SPECIAL SETTING.
other features***I HAVE NO IDEA HOW KODAK SOFTWARE WORKS FOR SAVING PICTURES.
quality***IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A REALLY GOOD QUALITY CAMERA AT A GREAT PRICE THIS IS IT.
pictures***I HAVE TRIED OUT SO MANY CAMERAS THE PICTURES ARE VERY CLEAR ON THIS ONE ITS A DURABLE CAMERA.
price***AND WORTH EVERY PENNY.
no feature***I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA!
no feature***I ordered -Drawers out come they never came!
other features***after two months i called customer service they sent another one THAT one took almost a whole month to get here.
no feature***Worst stuff sold BY AMAZON you cant track!
other features***-I didnt give up hope, I ordered Skintight IT NEVER GOT HERE AGAIN!!!!
no feature***i called after 2 months the company was so sure they sent it, they gave me back my refund and said refuse the bottle if it comes in the mail its been 4 months it never CAME!-I STILL didnt give up hope because some stuff i ordered from amazon was still comming.
