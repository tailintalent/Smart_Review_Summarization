size***The Nikon Coolpix S6400 is very small, measuring 3.8 x 2.4 x 1.1 inches and weighs about 5 ounces.
zoom***The 12X lens extends from a 35 mm equivalent focal length of 25 mm to 300 mm.
pictures***The 1/2.3 inch image sensor is typical of digital cameras of this class.
other features***Because the sensor's low light performance is proportional to its size (generally, the large the sensor, the better its low light sensitivity), this class of camera performs best where there is ample light.
zoom***On the other hand, also because of the small sensor size, it becomes possible to design a zoom lens with greater zoom range without prohibitive physical dimensions/weight or cost.
size***It is amazing that Nikon can squeeze a 12X lens into a case that is just 1.1 inches thick.
screen***The Coolpix S6400 features a touch-sensitive screen that does away with many traditional buttons; only the shutter, movie, play mode, and camera mode buttons are actual physical buttons.
screen***A 3-inch screen can be fitted here mainly because of the minimization of real buttons.
size***This also leaves very little space to place your thumb when holding the camera; luckily the camera is very light  so it doesn't strain my fingers when taking pictures.
no feature***I always tie a hand strap between the camera and its case (not included), so that I can hold the case with my left hand while I take picture with my right hand.
no feature***This is a safety arrangement to make sure that I am less likely to drop my camera to the ground when someone inadvertently bumps into me.
battery***Original manufacturer's battery is often very expensive (>$20), so I usually buy new third party battery on eBay.
battery***For the Coolpix S6400, you can typically get two EN-EL19 compatible batteries with free shipping for less than $10.
no feature***The EH-69P AC Adapter/Charger included in the camera package is in fact a AC to USB converter, not a standalone battery charger.
battery***This means the battery needs to be charged inside the camera, like so many others.
no feature***This problem can be solved with just a little cost.
no feature***While Nikon's MH-66 battery charger costs $42.95 retail, you can buy a third party external charger for the S6400 on eBay for $3.99, with free shipping.
other features***There is another model (S6500) that is identical to the S6400 except that it has an additional Wi-Fi file transfer capability.
no feature***I bought the S6400 because I don't need this feature and the S6400 has a better bang-for-the-buck.
no feature***Update (1/7/2014):After a few weeks of use, I found two somewhat annoying things about the S6400, which prompted me to take off one star from my original 5-star rating of this camera.1.
other features***Upon pressing the on/off button to turn on the camera, I need to wait about 8 seconds before I can press the shutter release to take a picture, so if I see something happening fast and whip out the S6400 to attempt to take a picture, chances are I would miss it.
other features***Moreover, if the camera goes into energy-saving mode after the default 1-minute time (user changeable), it will also take 8 seconds to return the camera to operation capable status.2.
screen***Touch control may not be as accurate and reliable as physical button.
screen***I cannot browse pictures quickly, as the touch interface simply won't allow it, furthermore, navigating a picture after zooming in is slow and unreliable.
pictures***Knowing now that the S6400 is not well suited for quick shots, I still like the pictures that the S6400 can produce.
zoom***The auto focus lens is fast and sharp, and the colors are very nice.
pictures***Pictures taken with flash always look evenly lit and well-exposed.
no feature***Nikon 6400.
no feature***Bought this to replace a old Nikon 3700. what a difference, the old one did a job over the years, thousands of pic and movies lot of wild life ..
no feature***This new 6400 is like a Cadilac compared to the 3700 being a horse and buggy, there is no comparison.
no feature***the old said 3x Zoom.
zoom***it would not zoom at 25 feet, looked the same as no zoom, I was leary of this one which is 12Xzoom, Oh the old one while in movie would not Zoom, the New one zooms in any mode and It is truly a 12 zoom, will try to attach 2 photos taken at 300 or more feet no zoom and 12 zoom, it does what it says.
screen***clear touch screen, that is a time saver, only had it a few hours and all ready learned a lot, touch screen makes it easy to navigate and change the settings, the old one never did learn how to use all the features and was terribly slow navigation.
no feature***Smaller slimmer can't say how much I like this 6400, at $129.00 it is a steal.
battery***By the way some one said charging is crappy, I ordered this from amazon and now have 3 batteries , one with it and the two with a charger, always have one charged, think I paid around $17.00 charger and two batteries at Amazonhere's the link B008UZHDOI5 day's laterBoy practiced on some squirrels at 80 feet, one was setting and one was in full run, both came out perfect, the running shot no blur, both filled the pic like they were 5 feet away,update two months of use, still love it more, But the batteries that I have the link to at amazon, why, because the stock sony battery failed to charge with very little use, the others are great, last forever.
no feature***can't seem I can insert a product link so heres the link copy pasteB008UZHDOI
no feature***I received this camera as a gift (purchased at Costco in a bundle pack).
battery***It works wonderfully as a simple point and shoot camera and has great battery life.
battery***I've had it for a year and probably have to charge the battery once every 2 months or so.
other features***Also, I had an issue with the lens retracting after my son dropped it about 10 mo into ownership and Nikon fixed my camera good as new for the cost of shipping it to them.
other features***So great customer service from Nikon!
no feature***I would definitely purchase this item again.
pictures***Excellent camera, great photos, present for my wife and she loves it, got the red color and its really beautiful...certainly will be easy to find....great service, and quick delivery.
no feature***I purchased the red S6400 when it was offered during the Black Friday Deals week.
no feature***I was primarily looking for a sleek camera that takes sharp pictures.
screen***The touch screen is a very handy addition.
no feature***My husband is a serious enthusiast and owns a Canon 5D Mark II.
no feature***To be realistic, this camera doesn't even come close to his Canon DSLR.
pictures***That being said, it takes decent pictures.
pictures***There is a fair amount of noise in low light shots.
video***The video quality is good though keeping moving subjects in focus is not easy.
ease of use***The camera itself is definitely easy to use, lightweight and looks good.
battery***Since the battery can only be charged through the camera, I purchased a third party charger and battery on eBay.
no feature***The information and specifications shown on Amazon for this camera are lacking.
battery***I assumed the camera would come with an external charger for the camera battery (standard with many other Nikon cameras but not mentioned in the description)  however that was not the case.
battery***The camera does come with a charger however you have to charge the battery while it is in the camera and the charging cord plugs directly into the camera.
battery***It's not always safe, convenient, or secure to leave the camera laying out while charging.
pictures***The camera is very slow taking multiple back to back pictures, with about a 5 second delay between shots, regardless of setting.
other features***The on/off switch is very sensitive.
no feature***I find the camera occasionally trying to turn on while in the case as the result of the slightest vibration.
no feature***For a simple camera it has a lot of features.
screen***Loved the touch screen for  taking pictures.
no feature***Its not that cheap plastic like some of the are made of.
ease of use***Very simple and easy to use.
pictures***A little slow to snap multiple pictures in succession, but that's what I have my big camera for.
no feature***All in all, a great little point and shoot.
video***The really fantastic feature is the video recorder, great quality!
video***This camera has fantastic features, such as 16MP, 1080HD Video, great wide angle and zoom, and touch screen controls.
no feature***It does more than I will ever probably need.
other features***The on-disc manual included is 280 pages.
no feature***I am very happy with this product.

no feature***Love it!
pictures***While the pictures come out well a line is down the middle of the viewer and now I have to take it in to a camera shop to fix as my  warranty period has expired.
no feature***Quite upsetting
pictures***Not perfect but takes really good pictures most of the time.
no feature***When it doesn't it's usually operator error and not camera.
no feature***Until I found this camera, I tried and had in the last 3 years more than 5 different brands (Sony, Samsung, Nikon, Panasonic and Olympus... sorry for not giving you the exact models, but were same small pocket sizes)...
no feature***So far this was the best!
pictures***Very, very nice pictures!
no feature***My wife is happy too... 100% recommended
no feature***Got it for Black Friday 2013 and its the best you can get as for cheap cameras.
zoom***It has decent Megapixels, good zoom and also hdmi output.
no feature***Would recommend indeed.
pictures***Got this on the deals of the day bargain and it is a great camera - takes fabulous pictures and movies.
screen***So glad I got this for myself for Christmas - only downside is the touch screen reacts fairly easily which means extra pictures taken w/o meaning to.
other features***Buttons push easily and can cause the camera to take a movie instead of picture.
no feature***Otherwise great camera.
no feature***The last point and shoot that I used seriously was an Olympus 35 MM point and shoot for traffic investigation .
no feature***This better than that in every way.
no feature***And it is a Nikon on top of that I still bring out my trusty FM on occasion to re live the glory days of 35 MM.

no feature***I have had Nikon cameras for years so I thought I would purchase this Coolpix to replace my old Canon SureShot that I was using for my everyday camera.
no feature***The Canon was old and was taking longer and longer for the shutter to click.
no feature***I was looking for an all purpose camera with a macro feature so I could take photos for ebay.
no feature***I purchased the Coolpix as a Black Friday Amazon special.
no feature***Ultimately, I wound up returning it.
pictures***It had a nice feel but the photos were mediocre.
no feature***I honestly could take better photos with my phone.
no feature***I did like the options on the Coolpix.
pictures***I liked the shutter speed and the wide angle of an average photo, but I felt the images had the distortion of a very cheap disposable camera.
pictures***Cheap cameras have a tendency to distort facial features - making a nose appear larger or making eyes appear more deep-set than they actually are.
no feature***Most people hate photos of themselves taken with cheap cameras.
no feature***You can occasionally get lucky and grab a nice shot, but overall cheap cameras make lousy portraits.
pictures***I suppose this camera would be nice for someone who likes to take scenery or action photos.

zoom***I was concerned about the focusing of this camera as some have mentioned in that it sometimes will not focus sharply.
pictures***Now that I have this camera and am using it I have found that if I press down the shutter quickly I will sometimes get out of focus photos, but when I press the shutter button part way down (or maybe slowly) the camera has more time to get the correct focus?I have found this seems to be the best method for sharp photos and I have not had any problems since.
ease of use***The Nikon P520 menu system only took me about an hour to make all the settings that I prefer to use which I felt was very easy.
design***Most of all I really like the looks of this camera, it feels great in my hands, very comfortable and not too heavy.
battery***The battery last longer than what I was expecting even with using fill flash for many of my sunny outdoor photos, so I can't complain about the battery life.
battery***Comes with everything needed to copy photos from the camera to the PC and charging the battery.
no feature***Same cord that I use to charge the camera battery also copies the photos to the PC as you can remove the AC connector and use the USB end to connect to the PC.
no feature***The only gripe I have is that there are no threads in the lens barrel to attach a filter to protect the lens glass, for a camera of this type that should be a no brainer.
no feature***I have ordered a slip on adapter kit for this camera that is threaded at one end for adding filters (the kit also comes with 3 filters), I will see how this works and report on this later.
pictures***All in all I am enjoying taking photos with this camera, I find myself looking for any reason to go out picture taking, this camera is really fun and I highly recommend it.
price***The price was very fair on Amazon.
no feature***UPDATE ON THE LENS ADAPTER.
no feature***I received the lens adapter with 3 filters and one of them being a polarizing filter.
zoom***The adapter is a hard plastic and slips over the outside of the camera lens barrel, fits nice and tight.
no feature***There is a small recess in the adapter so that it will only let you push the adapter on to the camera lens just a 1/4 inch so this is really nice and very easy to put on the camera lens, feels very snug and firm.
no feature***The adapter is threaded on one end where you would screw on the filters, this feels really secure and works well.
zoom***So I can say that I'm very happy with the lens adapter and the filters it comes with.
no feature***So far so good.
no feature***Ill start by saying I really dont know much about Cameras.
no feature***Im just the average Husband whos Wife has been saying for the last couple years that she would love a new Camera.
no feature***So this Christmas Ive decided to take the jump and buy her this Nikon P520.
no feature***Now I sat here like most of you are doing reading reviews and after about an hour I realized I still didnt know anything.
no feature***It seems like a good Camera but then there are the bad reviews also.
no feature***So I decided to contact an Old Friend that I hadnt spoken to in years who actually is a pretty well knowledged person at one of the Top Camera Companies that you see all the time.
no feature***After sending him the link to this camera we went back and forth and he explained  all the bells and whistles that this Camera had and also explained the pros and cons.
no feature***What I came to realize after a couple days and alot of emails was I still really didnt know much about this Camera.
no feature***So I left him with 2 last questions.
no feature***1) Is this Camera worth the money and 2) Is this Camera a Camera that you yourself with all your Camera Knowledge would actually purchase and enjoy.
no feature***His answer to both of those questions was a very strong YES.
no feature***Now thats what I needed.
no feature***I just wanted to hear from someone who knew all the bells and whistles that it would be a Camera he would trust to take the pictures of his life.
no feature***So I bought this Camera and without going on and on anymore then I already have I can tell you it was the best decision Ive made in a long time.
no feature***Of course I gave it to her early so by Christmas we would know what we were doing.
pictures***The pictures are Vivid and Vibrant.
no feature***2 words Ive never used in my life.
ease of use***Its easy enough to use for a guy like me but at the same time is capable of keeping the avid photographer happy with all the things its capable of doing.
no feature***So after all this I would say yes, buy this Camera.
quality***We havent had one issue with it at all and it really seems like we made a good choice.
no feature***Hope this helps the average Camera Buyer a little more then all the other head spinning reviews I sat and read for Hours.
no feature***I use both a Nikon D80 and a D3, as well as a Nikon FE (film).
other features***But, when I go on trips and I am concerned about getting a picture quick I only take my Coolpix P520.
pictures***The controls and capabilities on this camera have produced some marvelous pictures.
zoom***And, rather than trying to figure which lens to use and changing out lens, I am able to take the fleeting picture.
no feature***Sure the Coolpix P520 isn't my Nikon D3.
pictures***But, it certainly does take some very pleasing pictures.
no feature***In fact,one of my pictures taken by the Coolpix P520 that was posted on line was even chosen as a "favorite" by a professional photographer.
no feature***To say the least he was quite surprised when he noticed what camera I used.
no feature***Sure the Coolpix P520 has its limits when you compare it to a DSLR like my D3.
no feature***But, as is said: "There is a time and place for everything" - even in photography.
no feature***Took this camera to Europe and it did an awesome job.
pictures***Took pictures in low light in cathedrals and at night and all turned out well.
pictures***Daytime pictures could be controlled with manual exposures, etc.
pictures***The close ups were sharp and clear despite some shakiness on my part.
battery***The battery lasted a day and I was impressed that the camera would go into standby mode or turn itself off if not being used.
no feature***Love everything about this camera!
no feature***The Nikon COOLPIX P520 looks like a great camera, and based on the reviews I decided to buy it.
pictures***It did not take perfectly clear pictures but the camera was complex enough that I thought that it was my problem.
no feature***I bought the Photographer's Guide to the Nikon Coolpix P520 by Alexander S. White and I would recommend it as useful to anyone who buys this camera.
no feature***However, even after working with the manual, trying different settings, autofocus, program, different focus patterns, manual focus, etc.
pictures***the camera still did not take crisp, clear pictures.
no feature***It was a disappointment.
video***I did note though that the video camera function seemed to work quite well and actually focus better than the still picture mode.
pictures***I was able to use a software program and sharpen the pictures and improve them, but they still were not crystal clear.
no feature***I compared them to an older Fuji Finepix that I have that is 6MP and has a total 19X zoom.
pictures***Most of the time whatever it can physically include in its field it can take pictures of clearly.
other features***And the macro is very good, better than this Nikon 520.
no feature***Speaking of the 18.1 MP rating of the Nikon, I have found that 6MP make very clear prints on an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of photography paper and don't see the need for such high MP values.
no feature***I'm not saying I'm the final word on this camera.
no feature***There are many that like this camera, and have had success with it.
no feature***I returned mine and wanted to share this experience since others' reviews have been useful to me.
no feature***My Nikon P520, Firmware Version 1.0, will be returned for credit first thing in the morning --After shooting over 1,500 images, I have had it with this camera!I have owned several other Nikon and Kodak digital cameras that worked much better than this one...
pictures***What Nikon did well on the P520:Low-light performance.
zoom***What Nikon needs to work on IMMEDIATELY:Autofocus: Often fuzzy, almost always slow, somewhat unpredictable, sometimes balky.
other features***Frequent Software Lockups: The P520 will lock up frequently when in use, often when "just sitting" there between shots.
other features***In these situations, no combination of controls including Power On/Off will unlock -- you must open the battery door, and physically remove and replace the battery.
battery***Short Battery Life: The P520 will unpredictably, and very quickly, run out of power; and IT CANNOT BE RECHARGED WHILE POWERED ON.
no feature***This means that any sort of time-lapse photography is out of the question.
battery***Nikon must come up with better power-management software, and/or higher-capacity batteries -- and provide for live charging.
design***Ergonomics: The method of switching display between the LED and the eyepiece is clumsy at best.
ease of use***The menus are also seriously in need of work!Outdoor overexposure: The P520 does not handle daylight well, and even with flash does not handle backlit scenes as well as my other Nikons, or Kodaks.
other features***The GPS: Software is flaky and hard to manage -- this feature set must be reworked.
quality***Will I try another Nikon soon?I suppose so -- but this one really leaves me wondering if the Nikon people care about the quality of their software!Come on Nikon, step up to making a quality product before you release it to the consumers!
no feature***This camera has been perfect for me.
pictures***I'm just an everyday user and the camera is easy to figure out, and takes good quality zoom pictures.
size***The camera is lightweight.
zoom***The zoom lens is integrated, unlike the DSLRs that have removable, heavy, lenses.
design***This also means there's less chance of dirt or moisture getting in there.
zoom***The lens is versatile and I'm loving the 42x zoom.
screen***I like that you can flip and tilt the LCD viewing screen.
screen***You can flip the screen out and turn it all the way around so the person being videotaped can see themselves.
screen***You can also hold the camera high above your head, or way off to the side, and tilt the screen so you can still see the subject of your photo/video.
screen***I like that you can fully close the LCD facing the camera to protect it, or close and keep the LCD facing outwards - whatever your preference.
no feature***I put a clear protective film on my LCD screen.
battery***I didn't realize the camera doesn't come with a battery charger!
no feature***Duh!
battery***You have to plug the camera into an outlet to charge the battery inside.
no feature***Make sure you buy a charger with at least a couple of extra batteries.
pictures***I was very confused that this and other comparable cameras didn't have Image Stabilization, especially with such a powerful zoom lens.
no feature***I finally figured out that this camera has something called "VR" Vibration Reduction) which seems to be the same thing.
no feature***I love the red color.
design***It's beautiful.
no feature***I was in the market for a new digital camera and started out looking at entry level SLR's but after reading great reviews about the Canon Rebel T3i, I got to thinking about searching for camera that have some of the benefits but that are present in a mega zoom camera.
no feature***My last three camera's are all Panasonic Lumix's and I was looking there but did not see the sense in going from a 20 optical zoom to a 24.
no feature***So I narrowed it down to the Canon Sx50 based on reviews and youtube videos.
no feature***Well after doing my diligent research on the web, starting here of course, I always go into local stores and test drive these babies to see how I feel about it, and although the Canon is a great camera, it's not like I really needed a new camera, I just wanted one.
price***I stumbled into HHGregg and while looking, I noticed the Nikon and thought.... thats a real low price for that type of camera.
screen***It looks a lot like the Canon with the pivoting swing out LCD screen but it was priced like $160 less than it sells for.
no feature***Someone had mis-priced it on the floor.
no feature***I had not heard of the camera before and knew nothing about it.
no feature***So once the manager agreed to sell it to me for the incorrect price, I got comfortable, whipped out my cell phone and came here and started reading reviews.
no feature***YES, I still needed to do my research.
no feature***I purchased the camera!
other features***Here is my take after having it for a couple of days:Pros:- Great pics- Has wi-fi enabled feature (that's next for me to try out once I get the adapter) It only works on Apple and Android phones I have read.- Has GPS (although I opted not to turn that on to save battery life, but I guess I should test it)- Great feel with the rubber handle grip.
quality***Here is my take after having it for a couple of days:Pros:- Great pics- Has wi-fi enabled feature (that's next for me to try out once I get the adapter) It only works on Apple and Android phones I have read.- Has GPS (although I opted not to turn that on to save battery life, but I guess I should test it)- Great feel with the rubber handle grip.
quality***I found it very sturdy.- I love the LCD flip out monitor.
screen***I found it very sturdy.- I love the LCD flip out monitor.
no feature***You can do so many things with it, and it's only available in a few models in this price range.- Similar to the Canon Sx50 but cheaperCons:- It is not a out the box point n shoot camera.
zoom***I had to tweak it in the "P" mode and selected AF-F (Full-time AF) to get clearer pics on zoom (Thx for great customer service Nikon)- It makes more noise when engaging the zoom than I like.
no feature***I was told by CS to return it for an exchange and I plan to do that tomorrow.
no feature***However, I'm not sure if this is just the way they are.
zoom***Will see....- It is not a clear shot camera, you will need to wait a sec for it to autofocus which can cost you quick shots in a pinch or pics maybe being fuzzy.
no feature***That being said, it is still a great camera, especially since I got it new at such a reduced amount due to in-store pricing error.
no feature***I didn't want to pay the $450 in the store for the Canon and with the mispriced Nikon since I did not have to.
zoom***It does not have the same extended zoom as the Canon camera but long is never enough, if you can get longer I guess.
no feature***(Amazon.com sells the Canon for $369 right now.
zoom***)I've taken some really awesome pics both indoors and outside, but price being equal, I would suggest the Canon Sx50 at $369 here on Amazon because I think it takes better pics without the tinkering and has more versatility with a better zoom,( has a horse shoe and it takes pics in Raw.
no feature***Not that I would actually use those features).
no feature***Finally, shop around if paying more is going bug you when you find out later.
no feature***Right now here on Amazon the Nikon sells for $376.
no feature***P.
no feature***S.
other features***I don't know if anyone has tried the Eye-Fi wireless sd cards, this might work in the Canon, which would bridge that whole wireless feature gap.
no feature***SD Card Tip: if you have a SD card laying around the house, do yourself a favor and Format it before you use it.
no feature***When I put my old SanDiskHC 4 GB size card into the Nikon it showed that I only could take 91 pics before formatting, then after formatting it, it went up to like 3,000 or something.
no feature***LolThese are the SD cards Nikon recommends  SD memory card---  SDHC memory card 2---  SDXC memory card 3 SanDisk  2 GB 1  /4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB  /64 GB, 128 GB TOSHIBA  2 GB 1  /4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB  /64 GB Panasonic  /2 GB 1  4 GB, 8 GB,16  /GB, 32 GB  64 GB Lexar  --  /4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB  /64GB, 128GB
no feature***This is really the first good camera I have owned.
no feature***I usually just use my iphone to take picture but I decided to invest in a better camera and I am very happy with my purchase.
no feature***I also bought 4 extra batteries and a 32gb sdhc card which allows me to take about 3400 pictures on highest quality (the file size for each image is about 7 MB).
battery***Each battery only lasts about 200 pictures so make sure you get extras if you plan on taking extended photography trips.
no feature***In my recent trip to New York I purchase this camera at BestBuy.
no feature***I was unable to get this model in Amazon due to business trip timelines, but I want to share some info about this camera.
design***Initially, the camera looks pretty solid, the hand grip is very good.
screen***The lcd display is definitely super high quality.
zoom***One of the best features of this camera is the amazing 42x optical zoom and the full hd video quality!
no feature***I have some real cool videos of Time Square at night and really really looks amazing!I take some photos using the zoom and the auto mode in central park, so I invite you to look in the sample photos section.with 18.1 megapixels and cmos sensor, you cannot go wrong.
no feature***Please don't go for the coolpix l820 model, this is just better!
screen***The lcd screen have vari-angle so you can move it and rotate to take even better angle pictures!I don't use the GPS feature but is a cool one for the travelers to create point of views and save gps information on the photos.
no feature***I purchased an extra battery and extra memory card (8 and 16GB) because the camera only have 16MB internal.
no feature***I love this camera, is not a professional unit but is a really good device.
no feature***Recommend it!
no feature***All my life, I've used cameras that require film.
no feature***Two weeks ago, my wife and I acquired our first digital, the POWERSHOT S45, and last week gave it an initial workout at Bryce, Zion, and Grand Canyon national parks.
no feature***This review is by no means exhaustive as I've yet to master all of the camera's features; it's a summary of relatively superficial first impressions.
pictures***The bottom line is that this 4 megapixel device takes impressively good pictures of such high detail resolution that my wife, a graphic designer, expects to use its output in PhotoShop for her professional work.
size***It's small enough to be easily held in one hand, and is so light as to be barely  noticeable when carried in a small padded bag hung around the neck.
no feature***(The old 35 mm was a millstone in comparison.)
other features***The silvery finish is smudge resistant, as when handled with fingers made greasy with french fries.
battery***You may wish to purchase an extra rechargeable lithium battery.
battery***After neglecting to re-energize it overnight after taking some ten snaps, the battery pooped out the next day (in the middle of our Bryce exploration) after taking an additional fifty-eight shots.
no feature***Of course, being new to the digital experience, we were using up a lot of power constantly reviewing our photo masterpieces on the LCD screen.
battery***In any case, the power cell recharges surprisingly quickly.
other features***Also, we thought it prudent to purchase the larger 256 MB CompactFlash card (for in-camera image storage) to replace the 32 MB card provided.
screen***Speaking of the screen, it's fairly small at1.5 x 1.12 inches, and its display is very difficult to see in bright sunlight.
screen***And, if you need glasses to read small print, keep them handy to decipher the system's on-screen icons.
zoom***While the 3x optical zoom lens is swell as far as it goes, the inability to attach a polarizer filter can be immensely aggravating under certain conditions.
other features***The shutter button's surface is smooth and entirely flush with the camera body; I was insecure enough to have to constantly check that my finger was on the button.
other features***One of the camera's greatest strong points is its wealth of features.
ease of use***For the digital novice, this versatility is perhaps an initial disadvantage since it'll take effort and time to become knowledgeable and well-practiced in all of them.
ease of use***Indeed, the 181-page user guide is a prodigious read.
ease of use***But, it is, to the extent that I've so far digested it, commendably comprehensive and easy to understand (with a plethora of illustrations).
other features***The provided software and transfer cable made uploading of each day's output to our PC laptop completely effortless.
no feature***(My wife would subsequently transfer the image files to a CD for future manipulation in PhotoShop on her Mac.
no feature***)My wife takes a lot of pictures that leave me rolling my eyes and shaking my head.
no feature***Unfortunately, the digital nature of the POWERSHOT S45 leaves me unarmed with the old argument, "You're wasting film!"
no feature***Isn't technology wonderful?
pictures***After over a month experimenting with most of the function/settings, have to admit I'm pretty impressed on both built/picture quality of the Canon newly improved S45.
detection***Even at auto mode you can hardly produce a bad shot, provided that I'm a die-hard manual SLR fan of NIKO FM2 for nearly twenty yrs.
other features***Rarely need to use photoshop to polish/adjust pics taken by S45, unlike my previous digital camera which I have to spend lots of time to correct digital noise, redeyes..etc.
no feature***When shopping for digital camera, don't get too obsessed with megapixels or spec.
no feature***'number', what's more important are the software/chips which make the camera provide precise light sensing & focus accuracy as well as flexible tweaks when you want your pics to have optimum result at any given changing shooting environment.
no feature***This point is well taken by users of Sharp's 4mp digital camera which uses Canon G2 equivalent lens but produces far inferior pics than Canon's even though Sharp's camera cost 40% less (so is the quality...).
battery***For S45, a large capacity CF card & a spare battery is always a must if you do indoor flash shooting & prefer to store pics at high resolution(which gives you stunning result), costco's website do provide a package deals that include above mentioned extras at reasonable price.
other features***LCD comes with a clear plastic cover that gives you enough protection, or you can buy those LCD protection sheets for PDAs then cut to desired size for less than five bucks.
zoom***Exterior of S45 is a nice brushed metal finish which provides enough protection for its lens.
no feature***No comment on the software since I installed the camera's driver only & use photoshop to polish when needed.
other features***Twain driver is quickly recognized by most 3rd party graphic & photo album softwares when hooked up with PC.
size***Upon comapring Canon's G2,G3,S230 & S45, S45 provides the best combination between size/function/pic quality criteria & one can hardly go wrong with any of them.
pictures***Upon comapring Canon's G2,G3,S230 & S45, S45 provides the best combination between size/function/pic quality criteria & one can hardly go wrong with any of them.
no feature***The adamfblock (from SF) review above was just about perfect.
no feature***Everybody likes this camera.
no feature***But nobody thinks any camera is perfect, a rating should be given relative to peers, meaning in this case 5 stars.
quality***If you research this camera you will find no strong argument that any camera in its class exceeds the S-45 in quality/features.
no feature***The G3 is a better camera, but too big for my purposes.
no feature***I would miss all those spontaneous surprise shots if I ony had a G3, because I would not have it with me.
no feature***And while size of aternative really tiny cameras is nice, everyone agrees that the loss of features/quality in those is rather significant (at this point).
size***The S-45 is small enough to carry around most everywhere, I got the little leather container that can be worn on your belt like a pocket knife, that is nice.
no feature***If you only have one camera, and want to avoid any driving desire to replace it in the next 5 years, this is a good bet.
no feature***The Canon S45 is an excellent digital camera with a few drawbacks.
price***As far as 4MP cameras go, it is a bit pricey but the quality of the camera build and the features on the camera make it well worth the price.
size***While the camera isn't exactly shirt pocketable, it is still fairly easy to carry around with you and not overly bulky.
detection***On the plus side, the S45 has:1) 9 point AutoFocus
other features***2) DIGIC processor which speeds up capture of photos and their quality
zoom***3) 3x Optical Zoom (who cares about the digital zoom)
pictures***4) 4 MP picture quality
ease of use***5) Easy to use interface with quick access to manual settings via FUNC button
ease of use***6) close to centered tripod attachment for easier stitch photo taking
other features***7) A ton of manual settings (exposure settings, aperture settings, shutter settings, white balance, photo effects, and more!) Almost all the settings available on Canon's high end G3 camera!
other features***8) A pretty tough metal body
other features***9) Ability of the camera to take RAW shots for photoediting.
detection***On the minus side:1) Decent to weak flash that is better than the S400 but still weak for low light and night photos at greater than 10 feet away.
battery***2) Decent to below average battery life... 200 shots on a full charge with LCD on in my experience
other features***3) Slide door that protects lens and doubles as power switch worries me in quality a bit.
detection***4) Red eye problems with straight flash use but much less so when the red eye reduction is used.
other features***5) I wish it had a hot shoe or some other way to add an external flash unit.
pictures***The camera takes fantastic shots even when in manual mode although its strengths will be found when you learn the manual settings of the camera.
no feature***I think this is a better buy than the Canon S400 since they are the same price.
size***If you're willing to sacrifice a little size... this Canon won't disappoint!
no feature***After extensive research, I decided on this camera as a replacement for my older 2 megapixel Olympus 2040.
size***I have been very impressed with it so far - it seems very well built (sturdy), is small enough to fit in my coat pocket, and takes great pictures.
zoom***The telescoping lens extends and retracts very quickly making it easy to take a picture on a moment's notice - this was a problem with my old camera - it was too slow.
no feature***When researching the camera, I was trying to find one that took "AA" batteries since they are much cheaper (NiMH).
battery***However, the Canon NB-2L battery isn't too expensive if purchased from a third party retailer (I got a generic one for [$$]).
other features***Also, the included charger is very small and portable with built in retractable AC plug - it's lightweight and easy to throw in a bag and take with you.
detection***The camera records the orientation that each photo is shot with in the EXIF header, and if you use the bundled Canon software to download the photos, it auto-rotates them for you.
no feature***This is very handy.
no feature***Unfortunately, it doesn't work if you use other software such as iPhoto or Image Capture.
ease of use***The mode dial is very handy - it has enough settings on it (ie, automatic, manual, shutter priority, aperture priority, night shot, portrait, movie mode, etc.)
no feature***that you can quickly flip to the one you want.
no feature***My old camera required the use of menu systems to set most of these modes - the dial is much faster.
other features***The camera features a stitch mode which allows you to stitch together multiple pictures to form a panorama.
other features***When in this mode, the camera shows you the last picture you took (offset to the side) allowing you to roughly overlap 1/3 of the next picture with the previous one.
other features***Using the included stitch software, I was able to easily make a Quicktime VR movie - pretty cool.
other features***You can also make panoramas with this mode, and unlike some manufacturers (Olympus), this works with any brand of CF card, it doesn't have to be the manufacturer supplied one.
other features***The only drawback I've found for this camera is the lack of a USB auto-mounter feature ("Mass Storage Device") which many other cameras have.
other features***This feature allows you to just plug in the USB cable to your computer and have the camera auto-mount on your desktop like any other removable disk.
other features***I wish Canon would include this feature since it enables you to completely bypass software for the import process.
no feature***This is something I can live without though - the other features make up for it.
no feature***Overall, a great camera which I would highly recommend!
no feature***When my Nikon CoolPix died after two years, I decided to go back to the brand that I have had all my life, Canons.
no feature***I must say that I am not disappointed.
no feature***The choice was between the S45 and the G3, I decided to go with the S45 bacause of its size and I figured I could do without the ND filter on the G3.
no feature***The S45 is amazing.
detection***Incredible focusing speed and image capture.
no feature***My Nikon would take so long to capture the image that the subject would move, ruining the composition, not so with the S45.
no feature***It is truly one of the best digicams on the market.
pictures***The images are crisp and true to life and the colors are just brilliant.
no feature***What can I say, I am back on the Canon train.
no feature***I bought this camera a few months ago.
no feature***I really like it but I found some drawbacks on this qonderful camera.
no feature***(It is impossible for me to find a perfect camera)1.
zoom***Zoom control is not easy to use.
zoom***Unlike S400, zoom is locked in step.
zoom***The control is ok but not as good as traditional SLR cameras or S400.2.
detection***When you switch to P, A, S, etc mode the 9 points auto focus function is gone.
no feature***This is not a big deal though if you can use the other auto functions.3.
zoom***I wish they change the way len is cover by sliding cover.
zoom***I don't feel very confident that the len is protected by dust.4.
other features***Macro is not working very well.
no feature***I guess it must be the same as most digital camera.
no feature***Ok.
no feature***Most of these complaint (except the first one) I fully expected when I bought.
no feature***Why the heck I bought this camera?1.
pictures***Canon digital camera has the best picture quality.
price***About the same as Nikon but cheaper.
no feature***Far superior than Kodak.2.
price***Compactflash memory is cheaper than other format.
no feature***Unlike other, high capacity memory card is available.3.
other features***More manual control over S400 but not too much as G serie.
pictures***I think 4MP is more than enough unless you want pictures more than 8X11.
no feature***Hope this review helps your purchase decision.
no feature***The Canon S45 is basically a revision of the S40 with some newer software included.
no feature***The S40 is itself a version of the Powershot G3 without the gimmicks like remote control, flash mounting, and a few other tricks.
other features***The sensor and optics are the same for all three cameras, the difference is in the software on the camera, the editing software for the PC that comes with it, and the gimmicks.
no feature***The S45 is a nice camera.
pictures***The user interface is much better than on the S40, and it still has the excellent color quality and image resolution of a 4MP camera.
design***It is ruggedly designed, has high quality optics and CCD, and numerous buttons that are out of the way for normal use.
detection***It has full auto and full manual modes, so it's appropriate for beginners and experienced users.
other features***The downside of the camera is the slow startup time.
other features***The flash is also in a spot where your finger might cover it if you're not careful.
pictures***There is some noise at low light levels, but this is true of all CCD cameras, and the S45 is about average in this respect.
pictures***The images are excellent at high resolution/large file size, but the included 32MB flash card is a joke.
no feature***Canon should know better, and ship all cameras with at least 256MB cards.
other features***The major downside of the package is the photo editing/printing software that comes bundled with the camera.
ease of use***It's user interface is an atrocity, buttons have icons rather than labels, there is no menu tab, etc.
other features***The camera is quickly recognized by USB port, and the downloads are quick.
other features***Just be sure to get Photoshop or another quality editing software package, rather than relying on the [stuff] that comes bundled with this camera.
no feature***I recently purchased this camera after having previously owned a Fuji Finepix 2600.
no feature***After owning the 2600 for just over a year the lens mechanism got stuck and the camera completely broke.
no feature***It had a 1 year warranty which had just expired, and there's no use paying to fix it.
no feature***I figured it was time to upgrade, so I spent hours and hours searching CNET and other review sites for 4MP digital cameras and I finally found this one.
no feature***I would have gone with the Nikon Coolpix 4300, except Canon had their Digic chip which was supposed to allow the camera to go from shot-to-shot faster.
no feature***Also I own an old Canon SLR camera, and I trusted the brand.
no feature***This camera is a very good transition from my SLR, much better than my old Fuji.
pictures***I wanted something with image quality close to that of my film SLR, without the bulkiness or price of a digital SLR.
pictures***So far this camera has done that, producing some wonderful shots.
detection***It has plenty of features ranging from customizable shutter speeds and lens aperture to exposure compensation and 12 scene modes, making it great for shooting in any condition.
detection***One of the great features is the AF lamp, a brief light that goes off before the picture is taken that helps focus the image.
detection***It works great for low light shots.
other features***Another astounding feature is the ability to set ISO speed, just like you would on a film camera.
no feature***My last camera was almost the same price as this one and has none of these features.
no feature***I guess that shows how much prices have come down in the past year.
no feature***There are not many cons about this camera.
size***It's smaller than most cameras with the same amount of megapixels, but it's still not as lightweight as some of the Casio models or Canon's digital Elph.
pictures***The pictures on ISO 200+ have significant noise, even with noise reduction, and the optical zoom could be larger, and the macro is sub-par, but that's really all that is bad about this camera.
battery***Battery life is great, although it uses a proprietary lithium battery.
no feature***Here is a list of pros and cons:
other features***Pros:- Digic image processor.
other features***- Large array of features.
pictures***- Great quality photos.
other features***- Panorama stitch mode.
battery***- Great battery life.
other features***- Movie mode with sound.
pictures***Cons:- ISO 200+ has significant noise.
other features***- Poor macro mode.
battery***- Lithium battery instead of AA.
zoom***- Optical zoom could be larger.
no feature***Overall this is a great camera and many other reviewers agree with me.
price***It's not too expensive but has features of cameras almost twice as expensive.
no feature***If you're a beginner photographer you might want to stick to something simpler, as the features are more than you need you, but if you're looking to move up from an old digital camera I guarantee this is the best deal you're going to find.
no feature***I purchased the canon after a long period of lamenting over the cost and the features of this camera versus a G2, or another brand (Fuji, Olympus).
no feature***After owning this camera for ~6months I am relatively happy with it.
no feature***I picked the S40 over the G2 based on power off to shoot time and abitlity to stuff it in my pocket in a hurry to switch from camera to DV.
no feature***The G2 took ~2 seconds longer to power up than the S40, and it is also quite a bit bigger.
detection***The CCD is the same, and I needed the point-and-shoot feaures also so the S40 was the winner.
pictures***Picture quality is superb, but you have to know how to shoot a good picture to begin with.
other features***The response time to capture an image is great if the AiAE is set to center weight and not evaluative.
detection***This helps to keep the desired target in focus and reduces autofocus times tremendously.
other features***The .avi clips are good quality so its a nice feature, but I wouldn't use it as a video camera, more for action type shots that you don't want to miss...
no feature***I've had my Canon S45 for about three months now, and I am still discovering new features that make it even more endearing.
pictures***The picture quality is excellent under almost any conditions.
pictures***The 4.1 megapixels are more than sufficient, in fact, I often dial down the resolution to save file space.
video***The movie clips with sound are much better than I expected.
design***The sturdy silver case with the clamshell cover is my favorite feature.
size***It fits easily in my pocket, and is easy and quick to open for that first shot.
ease of use***The software was simple to install and use, and the instruction manuals (almost as thick as the camera) were nicely done.
other features***I ordered a 128mb card with the camera, which holds an amazing quantity of photos and film clips - highly recommended.
no feature***There are only a few minor complaints.
other features***The viewfinder is very plain and doesn't display the digital zooming effect, so you are very dependent on the LCD screen.
screen***The screen is nearly impossible to see in direct sunlight, and the data is very tiny.
other features***Also, the low battery indicator doesn't seem to appear until there is only power for one or two more photos.
detection***Red eye can be a problem, although coaching the photographed people to look at the pre-flash srobe, as the directions explained, does work well.
pictures***And some photos containing horizontal lines can have a jagged appearance at some resolutions, but it is usually minimal.
no feature***But I have adjusted to these little problems and don't consider them reason enough to not recommend this little marvel of technology to anyone!
no feature***I bought this, for some inane reason that I'm thinking about now, for the fact I can share on Facebook.
pictures***A stupid reason I know, as iphoto has a facebook button that easily lets you share pictures.
no feature***That's the least of my problems with this camera.
size***First, it's a little bulky and didn't even come with a camera strap.
no feature***But the main problem is it is too tempermental.
quality***One slight click can quickly corrupt your memory card and be the difference of you being happy or crying over the 450 photos of your Italy trip lost.
no feature***Yes, they will be locked on the memory card, but they will not load into iphoto, flickr, photobucket, etc.
video***This happens when I switch to record video.
video***For some stupid reason, the video does not work right and it corrupts the entire memory card.
no feature***This has happened TWICE!
no feature***I went on a trip to California in memory of Michael Jackson, went to his houses and Forest Lawn and took many pictures so you can see I wanted them.
video***I also just tooled my city of Chicago taking pics of the sets of Transformers 3--more things I will never see again, and the video once again corrupted everything on the camera.
video***I don't know what is wrong with the video feature, but whenever I switch to take video, every pictures that is taken after the video does not show up.
video***Pics up to that first video will show up but will not come off the camera.
no feature***This to me makes this camera a piece of $150 junk that I can't return because of the measly 14 day return policy.
quality***I should not have to worry about using my camera and simply clicking one button to switch to video should corrupt and ruin all my photo memories!
no feature***I am disgusted this has happened a second time.
pictures***The pictures that do come out are beautiful, but there are other cameras that also take beautiful pictures.
no feature***I don't know if it is the camera, or some setting or what.
no feature***I have yet to find a setting that would result in this happening.
no feature***it is a headache to say the least.
no feature***If you do buy this, BEWARE of something like this happening, believe me it's not worth the disappointment and anger.
no feature***I would suggest you buy a Sony Cybershot or hell a Cannon.
no feature***Anything but this camera in particular.
no feature***If anyone has had this experience I'd like to know what you did to stop it.
no feature***Let me know.
no feature***angelsslayer@yahoo.com
no feature***I have this camera and I just love it.
ease of use***It is easy to operate, creates beautiful pictures - and videos.
video***(I have not yet learned how to increase the volume on videos, but will talk to support about it.)
battery***I have had no problems at all with charging the battery.... simply connect the camera via enclosed usb cable to an electrical outlet and it's charged in no time.
ease of use***It's easy to transfer photos from camera to computer folders - just select the one you want it to go into.
no feature***Yes, I would buy it again!
no feature***I purchased this for my husband's birthday.
battery***The battery will not charge unless the battery door is slightly open.
battery***After the charge is complete, the camera will not operate unless the battery door is slightly open.
no feature***If you close it, the camera will turn off.
no feature***We returned it, and got a replacement.
no feature***The second camera did the same thing.
other features***Chat support was no help at all.
no feature***They just told me to return it to the store where purchased for an exchange.
pictures***Pictures dont come out as good and some pictures come out looking fake.
no feature***not as crisp as I expected.
battery***Had to return first one battery compartment issue.
no feature***I know how to use cameras.
no feature***I had tried different settings and everything.
no feature***We bought this as a present for my grandmother.
no feature***We took it out of the box to test it and to make sure we knew how to operate it to show her.
ease of use***Well lets just say it is fairly simple, so we took a few test pictures.
quality***They turned out VERY grainy, with a lot of noise.
pictures***So we checked the settings, thinking this is a 12.1 MP camera could do a bit better than that, nope, my year old Sony Cyber-Shot took better pictures.
pictures***Also we uploaded the pictures on to my laptop and after the annoying software installations we verified that the pictures were indeed grainy.
no feature***I would advise anyone who is looking into this camera to turn elsewhere.
ease of use***This camera is easy to operate if you have used a digital camera before.
pictures***Takes good quality pictures, except for a few in low light conditions.
other features***It offers a lot of different settings for close-ups, nighttime, etc.
pictures***However, I suggest having the flash on for most pictures.
no feature***Overall, I have had no problems with this camera and would recommend it for everyday picture taking.
no feature***I was disappointed with the camera.
pictures***Picture quality, at best, is uneven.
no feature***I bought the camera with the idea that through its simplicity I might be able to learn my way into digital photography.
no feature***The only thing that its use has done for my picturing taking long-term is make me wish I'd spent the money for a better camera.
other features***The camera does not appear to have an anti-shake feature.
other features***The absence of anti-shake makes the zoom, which of itself is unimpressive, near useless.
no feature***When I was a pre-teenager, I received a Kodak Bullseye as a Christmas gift.
no feature***The Bullsye was a fabulous camera for the time.
no feature***Memories of my use of the Kodak Bullseye only heightens my disappointment with this Kodak camera.
no feature***I bought the ES M550 because a former Kodak camera was dropped and the viewer stopped working.
pictures***Other than that the camera worked fine but it was impossible to frame a picture as it has no viewfinder.
ease of use***The firing and control buttons are next to each other and cannot be easily distinguished in low light.
no feature***The firing button should have been separate, distinguishable and further right to avoid the confusion.
ease of use***The grip area is a bit awkward and is is almost impossible to shoot with only one hand, which I would say is a must with point-and-shoot cameras, no?The zoom is mediocre in range.
detection***When fully zoomed the photos will sometimes be out of focus.
other features***Another item is the programming.
detection***The smart-capture feature is a good idea because it will customize the focus according to the scene (macro or long shot) but cannot be customized enough to shoot flash in daylight, something called "fill-in flash" which any photographer knows is handily needed.
detection***You have to use an alternate setting that is not smart.
other features***The camera itself is not a good point and shoot device.
detection***The focused item can be selected by pointing the camera where you want via a small green rectangle, but this is the minority of cases.
detection***Most of the time with casual situations there is no time to select the focus and the M550 is simply too slow to focus and many pics will show up out of focus.
battery***A very dumb thing is that the M550 will not charge while connected to the computer.
battery***So you have to charge it first if you have a dead battery and want to copy the photos to the computer.
battery***The predecessor generation of EasyShare cameras did charge when connected.
no feature***I have 2 Corgi's that love to run and chase each other and play but the camera is so slow that the girls are out of the picture before I can snap it...and it wasn't a cheap camera when I bought it 3 years ago.
pictures***Picture quality is not that great.
battery***The battery just crapped out and I've barely used it.
no feature***Kodak has gone downhill and I for sure won't buy another Kodak.
pictures***Camera takes good pictures in light.
pictures***Its weakness is in low light where the pictures are not good.
battery***After owning this camera for a couple of years it has developed charging issues and is very temperamentalabout charging.
no feature***Otherwise I have been happy with the camera.
price***It it just what I expected according to price and description.
pictures***Takes good pictures, has a lot of features, easy to handle, in my case I chose blue color, I think it looks great.
no feature***I highly recommend it if you don't want to spend too much money on a camera.
no feature***This camera does everything I want.
ease of use***Easy to set up and easy to use.
pictures***Picture quality is great and the price was outstanding.
no feature***This camera work like a charm, I have not had any problems with it and I have been using it for 6 months now I think.
pictures***I got a used one, picture quality is great, tag feature is wonderful.
no feature***I love this buy.
no feature***I purchased this camera about 7 months ago as my previous Kodak Easyshare had given up the ghost.
size***It seemed to have the features I wanted for a point and shoot, was light-weight and the memory card fit into the card reader on my new ACER.
battery***The battery would not hold a charge so purchased a second battery.
battery***Same thing, no charge.
battery***Now the camera will not power on or accept a charge.
no feature***This is definitely my last KODAK camera.
pictures***I purchased this camera earlier this year and used it on vacation this summer for the first time and was very disappointed with the picture quality.
pictures***The pictures were very grainy.
pictures***I just bought this camera at Costco which included a four gig sd card and a case and strap wall charge plug and cable for computer and the wall wall charge plug, one out of four pics when tested on my cats was blurry, so far six more shots or so and only one was blur.
size***Camera is kind of tiny and I have small hands, cost me fifty five dollars with the instant discount they were offering there.
no feature***My last camera was a five hundred dollar sony that no matter how much you moved the pics were perfect, was five megapixels, this one in my opinion is worth fifty dollars or so, don't have to be such a finatic with it like I used to be with my high end stuff.
pictures***This one is twelve megapixels which means if I ever get a printer again I can do big prints and not lose resolution, which is nice.
other features***Seems a little slow to me on the time it takes to see something to the point of the photo being taken, my only complaint.
other features***I't has to lock on and do it's thing, my sony was instant or at least I remember it seeming that way.
price***But fifty bucks for 12 mp and 5x zoom (doesn't seem like 5x zoom) seems fair to me so far, and that's indoor tests only nothing with a good outdoor lighting situation where digital cameras really are meant for.
no feature***Note have not tried any motion shots.
pictures***I also notice the pics indoors when viewing lcd view look awful on the screen, I mean really bad, but once flash go's off the pics look nice, kind of hard to judge what picture will look like though indoors with not much light.
no feature***My sony was always clear no matter what, though once again that was five hundred dollars eight years ago not fifty.
price***I found the Kodak EasyShare M550 12MP camera on sale for $55, so the price listed here seems unusually high.
price***For the price I paid, it's a great little camera.
size***It's a lot less bulky than the Canon Powershot I was replacing and takes much better pictures.
other features***Plus, I love the Share feature (I didn't think I'd use it at all, but I really like it)!
battery***Many of the negative reviews I read before buying stated that there was trouble with charging the camera.
no feature***Initially, I had a similar problem.
battery***But then I noticed a little red switch inside the battery compartment which holds the battery securely in place.
battery***It isn't spring-loaded, so you have to use your fingernail to push it over the battery.
battery***Once the battery was firmly connected to its electrical contacts, it charged perfectly and seems to hold its charge well.
no feature***I was hesitant to buy this camera after reading mixed reviews, but I'm really glad I did.
no feature***For the casual, amateur photographer, it's an awesome camera.
price***I recommend shopping around, though, as I found it for almost half the price that was listed on Amazon.
other features***i've had 3 easy share.
ease of use***main complaint is that this newer model has buttons that aren't as user friendly.
ease of use***i hate pics in dark places (like concerts) and it's not easy to change from pic to video or other settings.
video***also, the sound on the video was messed up.
no feature***i'm returning this today and will search for one of the older easy shares that is WAY more user friendly than this one
no feature***I'm happy with this camera.
ease of use***I was looking for something that was rechargeable, more than 10 MP, and easy to use.
price***This camera delivers & is pretty affordable.
ease of use***It's a good point & shoot camera, but it does take some practice to get the hang of.
no feature***I would probably buy this one again.
ease of use***The Easy Share Software is a pain to use & install, but it does work.
no feature***Update: 5/8/11I had to send this camera in for service repair.
no feature***Kodak replaced the entire motherboard & sent me back the refurbished camera.
no feature***It was covered under the warranty, but getting the claim number was a pain because the online service tech made me retry everything I had already done to troubleshoot the problems.
other features***The USB port had been wallowed out by the USB cord & wasn't making connection, so the camera wouldn't charge or upload data.
quality***After receiving the refurbished camera, I still have some problems with it randomly turning itself off.
battery***I also can't really take it anywhere because the power button's location causes it to be turned on unintentionally during transport & I end up with a dead battery.
